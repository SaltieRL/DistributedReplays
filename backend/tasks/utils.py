    Celery uses PRIORITY_SEP to separate different priorities of tasks into
    different queues in Redis. Each queue-priority combination becomes a key in
    redis with names like:

     - batch1\x06\x163 <-- P3 queue named batch1

    There's more information about this in Github, but it doesn't look like it
    will change any time soon:

    In that ticket the code below, from the Flower project, is referenced:

      - https://github.com/mher/flower/blob/master/flower/utils/broker.py#L135

    :param queue: The name of the queue to make a name for.
    :param pri: The priority to make a name with.
    :return: A name for the queue-priority pair.
